tujr
====

This is a tuProlog REPL plugin for jReality.

To run the demo simply do "sbt run" and enable the Left Slot in the jReality window.  Click the tujr plugin and then submit standard prolog queries like "mortal(X)."

To use this plugin in your jReality application: create the plugin, give it your tuProlog instance, and register it with the jReality viewer, just like in com/github/dunmatt/tujr/Demo.scala.
